/**
 * @file LaneAssigner.cpp
 * @brief Implementation file for LaneAssigner utility class
 *
 * This file is intentionally minimal because LaneAssigner is a header-only
 * utility class with static methods. All implementation is in the header
 * for performance reasons (allows inlining).
 *
 * If you need to add non-template, non-inline methods in the future,
 * implement them here.

// Currently no implementation needed - all methods are static and defined in header
